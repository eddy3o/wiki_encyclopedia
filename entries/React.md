# React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was developed by Facebook and allows for the creation of dynamic and fast web applications using reusable components. React uses an efficient rendering system called the Virtual DOM, which optimizes updates and improves application performance.

Key features of React include:

* **Component-Based**: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
* **Declarative**: Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render the right components when your data changes.
* **Learn Once, Write Anywhere**: Develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.

The most recent major version of React is React 18.
